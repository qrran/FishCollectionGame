# Fish Collection Game

There are 2 main game objects in this game: ship and the fish. Ship will collect the fish after activated it.

## How to Play?

1. Click on the screen to spawn fish
2. Press space to activate the ship, then it will start to collect the fish around it by the order that fish spawned.

- Mac only detects mouseDown(0) as input and not detecting (1) and (2), I used (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) for spawning the fish, so I'm using space to activate the ship instead of getting another MouseButtonDown.
